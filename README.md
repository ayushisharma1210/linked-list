# linked-list
## abstract
Linked lists are fundamental in computer science and serve as building blocks for various data structures and algorithms. They are essential for scenarios where dynamic size and efficient insertions and deletions are required.A linked list is a data structure commonly used in programming that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element is a node containing data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
linked lists are used in programming for:
Implementing dynamic data structures like stacks and queues.
Managing data with variable or unpredictable sizes.
Efficiently handling insertions and deletions.
Building more complex data structures like hash tables, symbol tables, and adjacency lists for graphs.
Scenarios where random access to elements is not a primary requirement.

                                An algorithm for the provided code, which is intended to create and manipulate a singly linked list in C++:

Node Structure:

Define a structure node with two members: an integer data field and a pointer to the next node.
Linked List Class:

Create a class linked_list with a public constructor that initializes the head pointer to nullptr.
Add Node at the Start (add_start):

Create a new node.
Prompt the user for data input.
Set the new node's next to the current head.
Update the head to point to the new node.
Delete Node from the Start (del_start):

If the list is empty (head is nullptr), return or display an error.
Otherwise, create a temporary pointer to the current head.
Update the head to point to the next node.
Free the memory of the old head.
Add Node at the End (add_end):

Create a new node.
If the list is empty, call add_start to add the node.
Prompt the user for data input.
Traverse the list to find the last node.
Set the last node's next to the new node.
Delete Node from the End (del_end):

(This part is incomplete in the code provided. You need to traverse the list and remove the last node.)
Display Linked List (disp_ll):

Traverse the linked list starting from the head.
Print the data of each node.
Main Function:

Create an instance of the linked_list class.
Use a menu-driven loop to allow the user to perform operations:
Add a node at the beginning.
Delete a node from the beginning.
Add a node at the end.
Delete a node from the end.
Display the linked list.
Exit the program.
This algorithm describes the operations and logic behind the code, but please note that the del_end function is incomplete, and you would need to implement it to complete the program. Additionally, there are some issues in the code, such as missing return types for functions and missing main function declaration.
